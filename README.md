# Star
A Simple, Fast, and Easy Unblocked Gaming Site<br />
**<br />Please Note the Following<br />
This Project was fully custom-made with no AI, but AI was used to help create some parts of the code/Ai was used to help make stuff and will be credited within the code<br />
This Was Made Multiple Times in the past, so this might not be great. This is likely not the final product<br />
This Was Made with little to no experience with HTML, CSS, and JS<br />
This Site might not be good or great as it is still in the works<br />
This Project was intended to learn the basics, more, and help me learn about HTML, CSS, and JS**<br />
<br />
**Warning <br />
Please only play games in your free time or when allowed, as I am not Responsible for any Trouble Caused**
